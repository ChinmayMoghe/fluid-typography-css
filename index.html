                Gibberish – language that cannot be understood – is not quite the same as nonsense. In nonsense writing, we read
                individual words but can’t parse them into any meaning that makes sense according to conventional expectations.
                ‘Colourless green ideas sleep furiously,’ as Noam Chomsky put it in Syntactic Structures (1957), in an example
                of a semantically meaningless sentence with syntax present and correct. Gibberish, on the other hand, makes
                indecipherable words out of the sounds and letters of language. The giant Nimrod, who, according to patristic
                tradition, commanded the building of the Tower of Babel and thus shattered humanity’s single language into all
                of the tongues of the world, is punished with unintelligibility in the Inferno of Dante Alighieri’s Divine
                Comedy (1308-20). Guarding the Ninth Circle of hell, Nimrod calls out: ‘Raphèl maì amècche zabì almi.’ Ignore
                him, says Virgil, his guide, for he cannot understand us, just as we cannot comprehend his words.
